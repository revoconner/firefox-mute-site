# Mute Site
This is a Firefox extension that allows to instantly mute/unmute all tabs from a website. The mute button appears when a tab is playing audio. When pressed it will toggle mute on all tabs from that domain.

## UPDATES: 
1. Muted domain is now remembered through firefox sessions.
2. All muted domains can now be viewed in a list when the extension is clicked.
